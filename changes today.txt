                                & ((Result.is_error == False) & (Result.match_status == 'result')))

Updated result_is_new() method of the ResultsValidator class not to exclude results with errors when checking for duplicate results
Added check for results upload when week value is missing or contains invalid data (in such a case the result is stored as a fixture)
